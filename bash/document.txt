What is Zombie process in UNIX? How do you find Zombie process in UNIX?

When a program forks and the child finishes before the parent, the kernel still keeps some of its information
about the child in case the parent might need it - for example, the parent may need to check the child's exit
status. To be able to get this information, the parent calls 'wait()'; In the interval between the child
terminating and the parent calling 'wait()', the child is said to be a 'zombie' (If you do 'ps', the child 
will have a 'Z' in its status field to indicate this.)
